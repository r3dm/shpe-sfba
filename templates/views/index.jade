      p
        | The society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) was founded in Los Angeles, California,
        | in 1974 by a group of engineers employed by the city of Los Angeles. Their objective was to
        | form a national organiztion of professional engineers to serve as role models in the Hispanic Community.
      p
        | The concept of Networking was the key basis for the organization. SHPE quickly established two
        | student chapters to begin the network that would grow to encompass the nation as well as reach
        | countries outside of the United States. Today, SHPE enjoys a strong but independent network of
        | professionals and student chapters throughout the nation.
