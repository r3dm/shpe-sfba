    <p>The society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) was founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1974 by a group of
    engineers employed by the city of Los Angeles. Their objective was to form a national organiztion of professional
    engineers to serve as role models in the Hispanic Community.</p>
    <p>The concept of Networking was the key basis for the organization. SHPE quickly established two student chapters
    to begin the network that would grow to encompass the nation as well as reach countries outside of the United States.
    Today, SHPE enjoys a strong but independent network of professionals and student chapters throughout the nation.</p>
